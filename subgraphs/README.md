## Generate and build the subgraph
Edit the file: <br/>
subgraphs/hcce/subgraph.yaml <br/>
(replace <contract_address> in *dataSources.source.address* with the address of the deployed **ZenStaker** contract)<br/>

From this directory:
```bash
npm i

graph build
```

## Deploy to Goldsky
Guide: https://docs.goldsky.com/chains/horizen#install-goldskys-cli-and-log-in
For deployment details and options, follow the Goldsky documentation:
https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/

```bash
goldsky subgraph deploy <name>/<version> --path .
```

## Stable URL with tags (alias)
Goldsky supports tags to keep a stable endpoint between deploys.

Create a tag (first release):
```bash
goldsky subgraph tag create <name>/<version> --tag prod
```

Stable endpoint:
```
https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/<PROJECT_ID>/subgraphs/<name>/prod/gn
```

Update the tag to point to a new version:
```bash
goldsky subgraph deploy <name>/<new-version> --path .
goldsky subgraph tag create <name>/<new-version> --tag prod
```
